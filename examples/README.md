# AmazonDRS Examples #

This document describes the example applications provided with the [AmazonDRS library](../README.md).

## Replenish example ##

The example:
- Authenticates the device on Amazon platform using the library's [login()](../README.md#logindevicemodel-deviceserial-onauthenticated-testdevice) method which provides the authentication flow described [here](../README.md#authentication)
- Executes the following cycle: places a test order, waits for 8 sec, cancels the order, waits for 12 sec
- Logs all responses received from the Amazon DRS

**Please note that this example is not production-oriented at least due to the necessity of exposing agent's URL.**

Source code: [Replenish.agent.nut](./Replenish.agent.nut)

## Example Setup and Run ##

### Login To Amazon ###

Login to [Amazon Developer Services](https://developer.amazon.com/login.html).
If you are not registered as a developer, create a developer's account.

### Set Up Imp Device ###

1. [Set up a device](https://developer.electricimp.com/gettingstarted)
1. In the [Electric Imp's IDE](https://impcentral.electricimp.com) create new Product and Development Device Group.
1. Assign the device to the newly created Device Group.
1. Copy the [Replenish example source code](./Replenish.agent.nut) and paste it into the IDE as the agent code.
1. Make a note of the agent's URL. It will be required for the next steps.

1. Leave impCentral open in your browser &mdash; you will be returning to it later.

### Create an LWA Security Profile ###

This stage is used to authenticate the imp application in Amazon.

1. Launch your [Amazon Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/home.html).
1. Click on the **APPS & SERVICES** tab, then click **Login with Amazon**.
![LWA](images/LWA.png "LWA")
1. Click **Create a New Security Profile**.
![Create a New Security Profile](images/CreateSP.png "Create a New Security Profile")
1. Enter the following information:
    1. **Security Profile Name**: `example_sp`
    1. **Security Profile Description**: `example_sp_desc`
    1. **Consent Privacy Notice URL**: `https://example.com`
1. Click **Save**.
![Enter required information and click Save](images/InfoForSP.png "Enter required information and click Save")
1. Then you'll be taken to your list of security profiles. Click the gear next to the Security Profile you created and select **Security Profile**.
![Click the gear next to the Security Profile you created and select Security Profile](images/ViewSP.png "Click the gear next to the Security Profile you created and select Security Profile")
1. Make a note of your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
![Make a note of your Client ID and Client Secret](images/Credentials.png "Make a note of your Client ID and Client Secret")
1. Then click on the **Web Settings** tab and enter the agent's URL into the **Allowed Return URLs** field.
![Enter the agent's URL into the Allowed Return URLs](images/AllowedURLs.png "Enter the agent's URL into the Allowed Return URLs")
1. Click **Save**.
1. Do not close this page.

**Note:** any LWA Security Profile works only for the one agent the URL of which you entered in the **Allowed Return URLs** field.

### Create a device ###

1. In the [Amazon Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/home.html), click the **APPS & SERVICES** tab and choose **Dash Replenishment Service**.
![Open Dash Replenishment Service](images/DRS.png "Open Dash Replenishment Service")
1. If you open **Dash Replenishment Service** for the first time, Amazon may take you to **Dash Replenishment Account Setup**:
![Dash Replenishment Account Setup](images/DRSSetup.png "Dash Replenishment Account Setup")
    1. Click **Begin**
    1. Choose your `example_sp` **Security Profile**
![Choose your Security Profile](images/DRSSetupSP.png "Choose your Security Profile")
    1. Click **Next** several times and then click **Done**
1. Click the **CREATE A DEVICE** button.
![Click the CREATE A DEVICE button](images/DRSCreate.png "Click the CREATE A DEVICE button")
1. In the appeared window, fill in the fields:
    1. **Name**: `example_device`
    2. **Model ID**: `example_model`
![Fill in the fields](images/CreateDevice.png "Fill in the fields")

### Adding API Keys to Your Agent Code ###

1. Return to impCentral.
1. Find the *AMAZON DRS CONSTANTS* section at the **end** of the agent code, and enter the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Slot ID** from the steps above as the values of the *AMAZON_DRS_CLIENT_ID*, *AMAZON_DRS_CLIENT_SECRET* and *AMAZON_DRS_SLOT_ID* constants, respectively.
![In impCentral, set the constants in the agent code](images/SetConstants.png "In impCentral, set the constants in the agent code")
1. Again, do not close impCentral.

### Build and Run the Electric Imp Application ###

1. Click **Build and Force Restart** to syntax-check, compile and deploy the code.
1. On the log pane, you should see **Log in please** message. This example uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication, and the agent has been set up as a web server to handle the authentication procedure.
    1. Click the agent URL in impCentral.
![In impCentral, click the Build and Run All button to compile and deploy the application and begin device and agent logging](images/Run.png "In impCentral, click the Build and Run All button to compile and deploy the application and begin device and agent logging")
    1. You will be redirected to the login page.
    1. Log into Amazon *on that page* and go through the suggested setup steps. Amazon may ask you to enter your address, credit card information, etc. Press the **Complete Setup** button to finish the setup process.
    ![Go through the suggested setup steps](images/AmazonSetup.png "Go through the suggested setup steps")
    1. After that the page should display **Authentication complete - you may now close this window**.
    1. Close that page and return to impCentral.
1. Make sure there are no errors in the logs.
1. Make sure there are periodic logs like this:
![Make sure there are periodic logs like this](images/PeriodicLogs.png "Make sure there are periodic logs like this")
**Note**: The message "Your Refresh Token is Atzr|IwEB..." contains your **Refresh Token**. You may use it exploring the library or for testing purposes.
1. Your application is now up and running.
